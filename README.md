The goal is to classify images of palm leaves into catagories depending on mineral such as Boron(B), Potassium(K), Magnesium(Mg), Nitrogen(N),and Phosphorous(P). Since the excess or lack of minerals affects the appearance of palm leaves, classification with deep learning may help determine each catagory pattern more in detail than the human eyes.

This github repository is an example of using deep learning model in this field. The source code is compose of data preparation and visualization, model training with ResNet50 model and CNN-layer model, and model evaluation.
