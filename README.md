Dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvitbio06kvitbio/oil-palm-leaves">Oil Palm Leaves- Kaggle</a>

The goal is to classify images of palm leaves into catagories depending on mineral such as Boron(B), Potassium(K), Magnesium(Mg), Nitrogen(N),and Phosphorous(P). Since the excess or lack of minerals affects the appearance of palm leaves, classification with deep learning may help determine each catagory pattern more in detail than the human eyes.
